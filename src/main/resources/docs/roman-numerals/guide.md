## Steps

1. **Step 1: Convert Basic Values**
    - Start with simple cases like 1 ("I"), 5 ("V"), 10 ("X"), etc.
    - Write unit tests for each base case.

2. **Step 2: Add Subtraction Rules**
    - Add cases where subtraction applies, such as 4 ("IV"), 9 ("IX"), 40 ("XL").
    - Write unit tests for each new conversion and ensure all tests pass.

3. **Step 3: Convert More Complex Numbers**
    - Use combinations of symbols to handle numbers like 58 ("LVIII"), 1994 ("MCMXCIV").
    - Add tests for various complex cases to ensure proper functionality.

4. **Step 4: Refactoring**
    - Review the code for possible simplifications or optimizations.
    - Ensure all tests continue to pass after refactoring.

5. **Step 5: Final Verification**
    - Validate all test cases for numbers from 1 to 3999.
    - Consider any further improvements or alternative approaches for the implementation.
