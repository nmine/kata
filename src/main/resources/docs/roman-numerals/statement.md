# Roman Numerals Kata

## Statement
The goal is to create a converter that takes an integer (between 1 and 3999) and converts it into its Roman numeral representation. For example:

- 1 → "I"
- 4 → "IV"
- 9 → "IX"
- 58 → "LVIII"
- 1994 → "MCMXCIV"

Roman numerals are represented by the following symbols:

- I = 1
- V = 5
- X = 10
- L = 50
- C = 100
- D = 500
- M = 1000

Implement a function that converts an integer to its Roman numeral equivalent, following these symbols and their values.
